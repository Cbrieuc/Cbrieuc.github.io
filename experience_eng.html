    <h2>Olympic National Park - WA , USA - April to September, 2016.</h2>

When I was about to graduate with a Master's Degree in Ecosystem Biology at the Paris-Sud XI University (Now Paris-Saclay), I came to realize that the professional experience I had accumulated during my internship was essentially about analysis and research synthesis work, with a quite limited or not so diversified field work experience.
Aware that the ecology job market frequently asks junior positions applicants to have very specific or extensive field work experience, and still hesitant about what kind of job I wanted to look for, I decided to enhance my knowledge with a professional experience in which field work would be dominant.
I was lucky enough to meet Dr. Jerry Freilich (former Scientific research Coordinator at Olympic National Park) while he was giving my class a speech about the Olympic National Park's major ecological concerns. I saw an opportunity to improve my field ecology knowledge and offered the Park's biologists to come and work
with them as part of a volunteer program. One year later, after graduating with said Master's Degree, we were able to make that project happen and I left France to live in the United States for half a year with a couple of ideas in mind, without knowing how much I was about to see and learn.

Between 1910 and 2011, the Elwha river was having its natural flow slowed down by two hydroelectric dams, and its adjacent ecosystms suffet the consequences :
sediment retention, riverbed erosion, temperature augmentation with parasite proliferation, radical modification of habitat and living condition of several native species of salmonids
that were considered as a primordial food ressource by local native tribes...

  <br/>
  <br/>

In 2012, the dams were destroyed and so began one of the most ambitious ecosystem restoration projects ever undertaken in the United-States.
It is in the context of that project that I worked with both the National Park Service and the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe Natural Ressources Department from April to September 2016.
My mission principally consisted in assist them on several projects and protocols gravitating around the Elwha's ecosystem restoration and more generally their conservation,
organized around diverse topics : animal population surveys, revegetation, hunting and fishing ressources, invasive species, biodiversity assessment, among others.




<br/>
<br/>
Under the supervision of Kimberly Sager-Fradkin (Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe Wildlife Biologist and Project Manager), I had the opportunity to work on different sub-projects :

        <h3>Abundance and species diversity estimation of micromammal and vegetal populations around the Elwha's new floodplains</h3>
<br/>

Following the two dams removal from the Elwha river, the former reservoirs are emptied and become two large floodplains covered with a thick layer of sediments.
the Olympic National Park along with the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe decide to revegetate these barren floodplains in order to stabilize the sediment layer so
the native salmonid species can come back up the river in clear water, and so the animal and vegetal species native to this area can recolonize this ecosystem quicker.
It is, among others, on a study aiming at understanding better how the animals interact with that revegetation (phytophagy, seed dispersal, trampling)
that I worked wit the Klallam Tribe.

<br/><br/>

I participated in two sides of that project : Assess the abundance and species diversity of micromammal populations around the floodplains,
and its vegetal cover composition and how it is browsed or destroyed by animals. My work on the first part consisted in laying several groups of restraining traps
along forest-river transect, and check, measure, identify (or insert a chip) then release trapped individuals, often mice or shrews (Microtus sp., Peromyscus sp...).
For the second part, I helped the Tribe and the USGS (United States Geological Service) biologists evaluate what type of vegetals settle in the former reservoirs and
how much animals interact with them, along a grid of sampling points.

            <h3>Odocoileus hemionus (Black-Tailed Deer) and Cervus canadensis (Roosevelt Elks) population monitoring</h3>
            <br/>


Black-Tailed Deer populations are a historical, cultural and spiritual symbol for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, but also, and still today, one of the most important
food ressources for its members. The problem is that these populations are declining all over the Olympic Peninsula. Several studies have shown that habitat loss, predation, hunting but especially a
parasite causing hair loss are the factors leading to that declining, and the Klallam tribe, in association with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, decided to lead a research project
aiming at evaluating the actual status of the Odocoileus hemionus population dwelling on the Klallam tribe's hunting grounds<br /><br/>
My work on that projet can be broken down to two principal tasks : driving around the hunting lands of the tribe daily for several weeks to spot and capture the newborn fawns
so we could equip them with a radiocollar, take measurements, check for their body condition and release them. Then, we would continue driving around the tribe's hunting ground to make sure the
fawns and deers (captured last year) were still alive. When a collar tag sent a signal corresponding to a deer whose movement had stopped for too long, my mission was to find said animal to identify the cause of death
or pick up a shredded collar. This thrilling experience tested my ability to observe and process decently-sized mammals : spot and analyse a doe's behaviour to assess whether or not she has given birth, sneak up on fawns
and chase them at full speed in difficult terrain, or conduct a real treasure hunt to find a dead animal and observe the environment to determine the cause of death in a dense wood or down a deep ravine after a one hour trek
through a dense vegetation... literally breathtaking!


<br />
<br />
            <h3>Gathering data on a Fisher population (Martes pennanti)</h3>

When I was not busy processing mice or running after slightly alarmed fawns, I was helping the Klallam tribe's biologist maintaining a camera-trap protocol
which purpose was to gather data on a Fisher population for conservation concerns, a species historically threatened by fur trading.

<br />
<br />
<br />

Supervised by Patrick Crain and Samuel Brenkman ( National Park Service ), I was able to participate in several projects linked to fish biology :
<br />

            <h3>Monitoring the spatial distribution of native salmonid species in the Elwha River</h3>

When the two Elwha dams were built, 4 native species of salmonids (Chinook, Pink, Coho, Chum) foun themselves restrained to the lower part of the Elwha river,
even though they used to be able to swim and spawn all the way up. After the dams removal, it is crucial to know whether or not the native salmonid species are coming back up the Elwha,
which is one of the major reasons why the dams were taken down in the first place. I worked with the National Park Service biologists, using telemetry gear to monitor the
movement of previously captured salmons to gather data on the evolution of their spatial distribution along the river. As well as keeping track of the salmonids movements,
I helped on conducting numerous river surveys in which we were looking for salmon nests (called Redds) to get a better understanding of how high upstream and in what tributaries of the Elwha
the salmons were now interested in spawning.

    <h3>Gathering data on different rivers of the Olympic Peninsula</h3>

    During my work at the National Park, I worked with the Fisheries department biologists during the various surveys they conducted daily in the rivers of the Park :
    Looking for redds, counting fish with scuba mask and wetsuit while drifting downstream, gathering salmon carcasses to remove the otolith (calcium carbonate structure of the inner ear
    containing a lot of information about the fish life history), assessing the quality of fish habitat, removing invasive species, and sometimes
    working on one-off missions like making sure a construction site doesn't excessively impact the water quality of a river section.

<br />
<br />
<br/>
<h3>What this experience brought me</h3>

I had the chance to be able to work with a federal agency, a native american tribe, and with various people from different organizations on several environmental questions linked to the restoration fo the Elwha ecosystem.
Just like when I used to work on the <a href="#2015">Observatory for the Biodiversity</a> of the "Plateau de Saclay", it helped me understand how complex the interactions between the different
  stakeholders of biodiversity can be when it comes to such problematics. I was particularly stunned at how everyone I worked with knew each other and were eager to put their efforts and
  ressources in common to achieve their goals, and this is a work environment I deem myself lucky to have been part of for about half a year. This experience greatly
  contributed in improving my teamworking ability, a quality that has been crucial in every step of this adventure. I was also able to improve my knowledge about northern american ecosystems and wildlife,
  my ability to work in rugged terrain and weather and to use the various tools necessary in that type of environment.

<h2>Laboratory "Ecology, Systematic, Evolution" - Orsay (91) - France - March to September, 2015.</h2>

I had the opportunity to conduct my Master's Degree final year internship at the "Ecology, Systematic, Evolution" research unit under the supervision of
Dr Fran&ccedil;ois Chiron and Dr Carmen Bessa-Gomes, during which my mission was to oversight a preliminary study in order to set up an observatory for the biodiversity of
the "Plateau de Saclay".

<h3>Context</h3>

Historically, the Plateau of Saclay was a landscape dominated by agricultural activity. As the urban matrix extends, particularly due to the imminent development of a
global reach scientific and technologic cluster "Paris-Saclay", the biodiversity of the Plateau is threatened. the "Ecology, Systematic, Evolution" research unit
considers that landscape modification to come as a laboratory allowing us to study the impact of urbanization on the biodiversity of a formerly agricultural land.
My work consisted in drawing an initial profile of the Plateau's biodiversity, identifying all the stakeholders of this biodiversity potentially interested in such a project
and developping a preliminary functional approach to this future network.

  <div style="margin-top:20px;;margin-bottom:5px;display:inline-block;">

            <div class="tooltiptop">

                </div>
            </div>
  </div>
</div>

  <h3>Identifying the stakeholders and their needs</h3>

My first task was to identify the different stakeholders interacting with the biodiversity of the "Plateau de Saclay". I spent my first weeks researching about
all the organizations, institutions, associations, agencies and experts that could be interested in a network maintaining up to date knowledge about the Plateau's biodiversity,
and then contacting them to understand to what extent they would consider participating in such a project. It is also in order to figure out why they were interested in sucha  project that I contacted them,
because my goal was to develop a tool not only used for scientific research concerns but also able to benefit all the people interested in the biodiversity of this area.
What are the different uses a biodiversity monitoring network can have for the different entities involved? This is the question I had to answer before starting to think about how
to functionaly design such a platform. I was used to working on environmental thematics involving scientific research concerns, and after having met and discussed with all the potential partners
of the observatory, I realized that a collaborative scientific project such as this one could raise various expectations and needs : natural heritage protection, knowledge of surrounding nature,
valorisation of raw data belonging to one organization, use of the data gathered for a separate project or, obviously, answering to scientific research problematics.


<h3>The data : data-mining, data treatment, indicators.</h3>

Once the partners identified, I had to do a true work of data-mining to obtain enough data so I could draw a decently accurate picture of the Pleateau's biodiversity.
All the stakeholders involved weren't all eager to freely share their laboriously gathered datas to the same extent, and I had to organize
a good amount of meetings, phone calls and e-mail conversations to finally be able to obtain, often with the enthusiasm of their proprietary, biodiversity data concerning
my area of study. Data in the bag, I spent a fair mount of time uniformizing it and treating it. I was finally able to paint a first portrait of the Plateau's biodiversity, highlighting
the disparities between the different units of this area in term of species abundance and diversity thanks to simple indicators developed using bird data : available in large quantity and
particularly relevant when it comes to assessing ecosystem functionality.


<h3>What then ?</h3>

After managing to produce a first synthesis of the Plateau of saclay's biodiversity, I started designing how this observatory would actually work : how to create a platform
that can follow the evolution of this area's biodiversity and at the same time use the data obtained to answer the needs of all the partners involved.
My first task was to develop a method allowing to produce a biodiversity random sampling plan able to take in account and equally cover all the different types of landcover (forests, fiels, lakes, urban areas) of the Plateau.
Between algorithm development, fiddling with geographical information system softwares and R coding, I was able to develop an operational tool that can adapt to any taxa. Then, I spent the remaining time on my hands
to improve the partner network newly created and to think about the potentialities of this observatory concerning all the needs on which light had been shed on during my encounters.


  <br />
  <br />

This experience allowed me to get a deeper comprehension of the interactions between the stakeholders of biodiversity we often hear about. I realized
that collaborative science projects could be subject to a certain amount of constraints but that it could help create adaptable and powerful tools.
I worked with a lot of different organizations and people, with different needs and concerns, and it greatly improved my sense of initiative, my ability to network and the way I address
environmental problematics which implications often have a wider reach than scientific research only.
In addition to that "network" way of thinking, I developed several technical skills such as treating and analysing geographical data and I improved my knowledge in R coding and statistical analysis.

  <h2>Previous Experiences</h2>

  <h3>February to April, 2014</h3>

During my first year of Master's program, I worked for 2 months under the supervision of dr Carmen Bessa-Gomes ("Ecologie, Syst&eacute;matique, Evolution" research unit) on a study aiming at determining
the impact of urbanization on bird-feeder use by the avian community, in the context of a city-forest gradient.
My mission consisted in setting up and maintaining the camera-traps, gathering the data and analysing it statistically in order to answer these two questions :
What kind of bird species use the bird-feeder ? (specialists ? generalists?) in what proportions ? and do these proportions vary along the urbanization gradient ?
I spent my time installing and checking the traps, and identifying the birds caught on camera while browsing the experimental bird-feeders.
After looking at every one of the 120 000 pictures taken, I analyzed the gathered data statistically so I could answer the two questions this study was about.
This experience improved my ornithologic skills and my technical skills concerning the use of camera-traps, as well as my ability to run relevant statistical tests on an ecological dataset.

  <h3>June to August, 2013</h3>

After graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in biology and before my first year of Master's program, I worked for 3 months on an aquatic mesocosm protocol
(Foljuif biological station, France) under the supervision of Dr. Lydie Blotti&egrave;re, int he context of a study aiming at evaluating the impact of physical perturbations
and temperature on aquatic trophic networks, and especially on the occurence of late summer blue-green algae blooms.
I essentially collaborated on the technical aspect of the protocol, which means working on setting up and maintaining the experiment,
gathering water samples and running several biochemical and physico-chemical tests on them. I seized this opportunity to learn how to use limnology equipment and improved my knowledge about aquatic food chains.


  <h3>April to June, 2012</h3>

  Durng my second year of Bachelor's program, I worked for two months at the Institute for Plant Biology (Bures-sur-Yvette, France) with Dr. Martine Thomas and Dr. Thomas Gu&eacute;rinier where
  I conducted a study aiming at understanding the impact of a kinase protein mutation on the development of the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana.
  This internship was my first contact with the scientificresearch world and it provided me with knowledge about biochemistry, molecular biology and several techniques often used in these fields
  (PCR, Southern and Northern blots, Eletrophoresis, ...), a subject that had already drawn my interest.
  Quite far from environmental questions, I am still happy that I was able to live that experience since it helped me understand better how living organisms work on a
  molecular scale and it provided me with several skills in lab techniques often used in ecology.
